# Uber Data Analysis

This project explores an Uber trip dataset to uncover key insights into trip categories, purposes, distances, and other factors that affect Uberâ€™s operations. Using Python and tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset is analyzed to reveal trends and patterns essential for understanding Uber trip dynamics.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends, patterns, and outliers in Uber trip data.
- **Visualizations:** Interactive charts and static plots showcasing trip trends, distance analysis, and category breakdowns.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python:** For analysis and computation.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive analysis and exploration.
